      "\n",
      "1. **Understanding the Problem:**\n",
      "   - The tank is initially 1/3 full.\n",
      "   - Adding 16 gallons of water fills the tank to its full capacity.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Setting Up the Equation:**\n",
      "   - Let \\( x \\) be the total capacity of the tank in gallons.\n",
      "   - Since the tank is 1/3 full, the amount of water in the tank before adding 16 gallons is \\( \\frac{1}{3}x \\).\n",
      "   - After adding 16 gallons, the tank is full, so we can write the equation:\n",
      "     \\[\n",
      "     \\frac{1}{3}x + 16 = x\n",
      "     \\]\n",

      "3. **Solving the Equation:**\n",
      "   - Subtract \\( \\frac{1}{3}x \\) from both sides to isolate \\( x \\):\n",
      "     \\[\n",
      "     16 = x - \\frac{1}{3}x\n",
      "     \\]\n",
      "   - Simplify the right-hand side:\n",
      "     \\[\n",
      "     16 = \\frac{3}{3}x - \\frac{1}{3}x = \\frac{2}{3}x\n",

      "Assistant: To determine the domain of the function \\( f(x) = \\log_a(1-x) + \\log_a(3+x) \\), we need to ensure that the arguments of both logarithmic functions are positive.

The function \\( f \\) is periodic with period 4, meaning \\( f(x+4) = f(x) \\) for all \\( x \\in \\mathbb{R} \\). Therefore, we can reduce \\( f(7) \\) to a value within one period by noting that \\( 7 = 4 \\cdot 1 + 3 \\), so \\( f(7) = f(3) \\).\n",

      "Next, we use the fact that \\( f \\) is an even function, which means \\( f(-x) = f(x) \\). Thus, \\( f(3) = f(-3) \\). Since \\( -3 = -4 + 1 \\), we have \\( f(-3) = f(1) \\) due to the periodicity. We are given that \\( f(x) = 2^x - 1 \\\n",
